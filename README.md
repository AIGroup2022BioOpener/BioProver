The Elastic model is too big to transfer to github for now. I tried to download the file from Google Drive in the code, but encountered some problems and will fix them later. 

The temporary solution is to download "ElasticFaceArc.pth" directly from the Google Drive and put it in the root of the working path. Then install the imported package and run example.py.
